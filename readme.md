# UI Mockups Collection

This repository contains a collection of small UI mockups that I've created. Some of these mockups are designed using plain HTML and CSS, while others leverage React for more dynamic interactions.

## Installation

To explore these mockups locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ketsueki33/UI-Mockups.git
```

2. Navigate to a specific mockup folder:
```bash
cd UI-Mockups/specific-mockup
```

3. Open `index.html` 

    - If its a React project, you can open `dist/index.html` after running:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

#### Credits

For some of the designs, inspiration was taken from various sources. In cases where a design was directly replicated, credit to the original creator is provided in the respective folder's README.
